 abstract = {We investigated; 1) the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF), 2) the influence of end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) on CBF, and 3) the potential for an extracranial blood steal from the anterior brain region during passive hyperthermia. Nineteen (13 male) volunteers underwent supine passive heating until a steady state esophageal temperature of 2°C above resting was established. Measurements were obtained; 1) while normothermic (Normo); 2) during poikilocapnic hyperthermia (Hyper), and 3) during hyperthermia with PETCO2 and PETO2 clamped to Normo levels (Hyper-clamp). Blood flow of the internal carotid (QICA), vertebral (QVA) and external carotid (QECA) arteries (Duplex Ultrasound); blood velocity of the middle cerebral (MCAv) and posterior cerebral (PCAv) arteries (transcranial Doppler); and cutaneous vascular conductance on the cheek (Cheek CVC; Doppler velocimetry), were measured at each stage. During Hyper, PETCO2 was lowered by 7.0±5.2mmHg, resulting in a reduction of QICA (-18±17%), QVA (-31±21%), MCAv (-22±13%) and PCAv (-18±10%) compared to Normo (P\textless0.05). The reduction in QVA was greater than that of QICA (P=0.017), MCAv (P=0.047), and PCAv (P=0.034). Blood flow/velocity was completely restored in each intracranial vessel (ICA, VA, MCA, PCA) during Hyper-clamp. Despite a \textasciitilde250% increase in QECA and subsequent increase in cheek CVC during Hyper compared to Normo, reductions in QICA were unrelated to changes in QECA. These data provide three novel findings; 1) hyperthermia attenuates QVA to a greater extent than QICA, 2) reductions in CBF during hyperthermia are governed primarily by reductions in PaCO2 and, 3) increased QECA is unlikely to compromise QICA during hyperthermia.},
