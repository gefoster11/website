AB  - Hypercapnic chemosensitivity is the response to the increased partial pressure of 
      carbon dioxide and results from central and peripheral chemosensor stimulation. 
      The hypercapnic chemosensitivity of the peripheral chemoreceptors is potentially 
      impacted by acute exercise, aerobic fitness, and sex. We sought to determine the 
      peripheral chemoresponse to transient hypercapnia at rest and during exercise in 
      males and females of various fitness. We hypothesized that 1) higher fitness 
      participants would have lower hypercapnic chemosensitivity compared with those 
      with lower fitness and 2) males would have a higher chemoresponse than females. 
      Forty healthy participants (20 females) participated in one test day involving 
      transient hypercapnic chemosensitivity testing and a maximal exercise test. 
      Chemosensitivity testing involved two breaths of 10% CO(2) repeated five times 
      (45 s to 1 min between repeats) at rest and the first two stages of a maximal 
      exercise test. There was no significant difference between higher and lower 
      aerobic fitness groups, (mean difference 0.23 ± 0.22 rest; -0.07 ± 0.04 stage 1; 
      0.11 ± 0.17 stage 2 L/mmHg·min) during each stage (P = 0.472). However, we saw a 
      significant increase in the hypercapnic response during stage 1 (0.98 ± 0.4 
      L/mmHg·min) compared with rest (0.79 ± 0.5 L/mmHg·min; P = 0.01). Finally, at 80 
      W, males had a higher chemoresponse compared with females, which persisted 
      following body surface area correction (0.56 ± 0.2 vs. 0.42 ± 0.2 
      L/mmHg·min·m(2), for females and males respectively (P = 0.038). Our findings 
      suggest that sex, unlike aerobic fitness, influences peripheral hypercapnic 
      chemosensitivity and that context (i.e., rest vs. exercise) is an important 
      consideration.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The hypercapnic chemoresponse to transient CO(2) 
      showed an increase during acute physical activity; however, this response did not 
      persist with further increases in intensity and was not different between 
      participants of different aerobic fitness. Males and females show a differing 
      response to CO(2) during exercise when compared with an iso-V̇co(2). Our results 
      suggest that adaptations that lead to increased aerobic fitness do not impact the 
      hypercapnic ventilatory response but there is an effect of sex.
