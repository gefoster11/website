AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Coronary blood flow in 
      healthy humans is controlled by both local metabolic signalling and adrenergic 
      activity: does the integration of these signals during acute hypoxia and adrenergic 
      activation differ between sexes? What are the main findings and its importance? Both 
      males and females exhibit an increase in coronary blood velocity in response to 
      acute hypoxia, a response that is constrained by adrenergic stimulation in males but 
      not females. These findings suggest that coronary blood flow control differs between 
      males and females. ABSTRACT: Coronary hyperaemia is mediated through multiple 
      signalling pathways, including local metabolic messengers and adrenergic 
      stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether the coronary vascular response to 
      adrenergic stressors is different between sexes in normoxia and hypoxia. Young, 
      healthy participants (n = 32; 16F) underwent three randomized trials of isometric 
      handgrip exercise followed by post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) to activate 
      the muscle metaboreflex. End-tidal PO2 was controlled at (1) normoxic levels 
      throughout the trial, (2) 50 mmHg for the duration of the trial (hypoxia trial), or 
      (3) 50 mmHg only during PECO (mixed trial). Mean left anterior descending coronary 
      artery velocity (LAD(Vmean) ; transthoracic Doppler echocardiography), heart rate 
      and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and during PECO. In normoxia, there was 
      no change in LAD(Vmean) or cardiac workload induced by PECO in males and females. 
      Acute hypoxia increased baseline LAD(Vmean) to a greater extent in males compared 
      with females (P < 0.05), despite a similar increase in cardiac workload. The change 
      in LAD(Vmean) induced by PECO was similar between sexes in normoxia (P = 0.31), 
      greater in males during the mixed trial (male: 12.8 (7.7) cm/s vs. female: 8.1 (6.3) 
      cm/s; P = 0.02) and reduced in males but not females in acute hypoxia (male: -4.8 
      (4.5) cm/s vs. female: 0.8 (6.2) cm/s; P = 0.006). In summary, sex differences in 
      the coronary vasodilatory response to hypoxia were observed, and metaboreflex 
      activation during hypoxia caused a paradoxical reduction in coronary blood velocity 
      in males but not females.
