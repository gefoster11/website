abstract: "Coronary hyperaemia is mediated through multiple signalling pathways, including local metabolic messengers and adrenergic stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether the coronary vascular response to adrenergic stressors is different between sexes in normoxia and hypoxia. Young, healthy participants (n = 32; 16F) underwent three randomized trials of isometric handgrip exercise followed by post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) to activate the muscle metaboreflex. End-tidal PO2 was controlled at (1) normoxic levels throughout the trial, (2) 50 mmHg for the duration of the trial (hypoxia trial), or (3) 50 mmHg only during PECO (mixed trial). Mean left anterior descending coronary artery velocity (LADVmean ; transthoracic Doppler echocardiography), heart rate and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and during PECO. In normoxia, there was no change in LADVmean or cardiac workload induced by PECO in males and females. Acute hypoxia increased baseline LADVmean to a greater extent in males compared with females (P < 0.05), despite a similar increase in cardiac workload. The change in LADVmean induced by PECO was similar between sexes in normoxia (P = 0.31), greater in males during the mixed trial (male: 12.8 (7.7) cm/s vs. female: 8.1 (6.3) cm/s; P = 0.02) and reduced in males but not females in acute hypoxia (male: -4.8 (4.5) cm/s vs. female: 0.8 (6.2) cm/s; P = 0.006). In summary, sex differences in the coronary vasodilatory response to hypoxia were observed, and metaboreflex activation during hypoxia caused a paradoxical reduction in coronary blood velocity in males but not females."
