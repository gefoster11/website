abstract: "The assessment of left ventricular (LV) contractility in animal models is useful in various experimental paradigms, yet obtaining such measures is inherently challenging and surgically invasive. In a cross-species study using small and large animals, we comprehensively tested the agreement and validity of multiple single-beat surrogate metrics of LV contractility against the field-standard metrics derived from inferior vena cava occlusion (IVCO). Fifty-six rats, 27 minipigs and 11 conscious dogs underwent LV and arterial catheterization and were assessed for a range of single-beat metrics of LV contractility. All single-beat metrics were tested for the various underlying assumptions required to be considered a valid metric of cardiac contractility, including load-independency, sensitivity to inotropic stimulation, and ability to diagnose contractile dysfunction in cardiac disease. Of all examined single-beat metrics, only LV maximal pressure normalized to end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic pressure normalized to EDV, and the maximal rate of rise of the LV pressure normalized to EDV showed a moderate-to-excellent agreement with their IVCO-derived reference measure and met all the underlying assumptions required to be considered as a valid cardiac contractile metric in both rodents and large-animal models. Our findings demonstrate that single-beat metrics can be used as a valid, reliable method to quantify cardiac contractile function in basic/preclinical experiments utilizing small- and large-animal models."
