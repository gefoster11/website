AB  - The assessment of left ventricular (LV) contractility in animal models is useful 
      in various experimental paradigms, yet obtaining such measures is inherently 
      challenging and surgically invasive. In a cross-species study using small and 
      large animals, we comprehensively tested the agreement and validity of multiple 
      single-beat surrogate metrics of LV contractility against the field-standard 
      metrics derived from inferior vena cava occlusion (IVCO). Fifty-six rats, 27 
      minipigs and 11 conscious dogs underwent LV and arterial catheterization and were 
      assessed for a range of single-beat metrics of LV contractility. All single-beat 
      metrics were tested for the various underlying assumptions required to be 
      considered a valid metric of cardiac contractility, including load-independency, 
      sensitivity to inotropic stimulation, and ability to diagnose contractile 
      dysfunction in cardiac disease. Of all examined single-beat metrics, only LV 
      maximal pressure normalized to end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic pressure 
      normalized to EDV, and the maximal rate of rise of the LV pressure normalized to 
      EDV showed a moderate-to-excellent agreement with their IVCO-derived reference 
      measure and met all the underlying assumptions required to be considered as a 
      valid cardiac contractile metric in both rodents and large-animal models. Our 
      findings demonstrate that single-beat metrics can be used as a valid, reliable 
      method to quantify cardiac contractile function in basic/preclinical experiments 
      utilizing small- and large-animal models KEY POINTS: Validating and comparing 
      indices of cardiac contractility that avoid caval occlusion would offer 
      considerable advantages for the field of cardiovascular physiology. We 
      comprehensively test the underlying assumptions of multiple single-beat indices 
      of cardiac contractility in rodents and translate these findings to pigs and 
      conscious dogs. We show that when performing caval occlusion is unfeasible, 
      single-beat metrics can be utilized to accurately quantify cardiac inotropic 
      function in basic and preclinical research employing various small and large 
      animal species. We report that maximal left-ventricular (LV)-pressure normalized 
      to end-diastolic volume (EDV), LV end-systolic pressure normalized to EDV and the 
      maximal rate of rise of the LV pressure waveform normalized to EDV are the best 
      three single-beat metrics to measure cardiac inotropic function in both small- 
      and large-animal models.
