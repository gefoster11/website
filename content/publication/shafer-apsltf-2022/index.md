abstract: "Baroreflex resetting permits sympathetic long-term facilitation (sLTF) following hypoxia; however, baroreflex control of action potential (AP) clusters and AP recruitment patterns facilitating sLTF is unknown. We hypothesized that baroreflex resetting of arterial pressure operating points (OPs) of AP clusters and recruitment of large-amplitude APs would mediate sLTF following hypoxia. Eight men (age: 24 (3) years; body mass index: 24 (3) kg/m2 ) underwent 20 min isocapnic hypoxia (PETO2: 47 (2) mmHg) and 30 min recovery. Multi-unit microneurography (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA) and a continuous wavelet transform with matched mother wavelet was used to detect sympathetic APs during baseline, hypoxia, early (first 5 min), and late recovery (last 5 min). AP amplitude (normalized to largest baseline AP amplitude), percentage APs occurring outside a MSNA burst (percentage asynchronous APs), and proportion of APs firing in small (1-3), medium (4-6) and large (7-10) normalized cluster sizes was calculated. Normalized clusters were used to assess baroreflex OPs and sensitivity. Hypoxia increased total MSNA activity, which remained elevated during recovery (P < 0.0001). Baroreflex OPs were shifted rightward for all clusters in recovery, with no effect on slope. Compared to baseline, AP amplitude was elevated by 3 (2)% and 4 (2)% while asynchronous APs were reduced by 9 (5)% and 7 (6)% in early and late recovery, respectively. In early recovery, the proportion of APs firing in large clusters was increased compared to baseline. Hypoxia-induced sLTF is mediated by baroreflex resetting of AP clusters to higher OPs, reduced asynchronous AP firing, and increased contribution from large-amplitude APs. KEY POINTS: Acute isocapnic hypoxia resets the arterial baroreflex and permits long-lasting sympathoexcitation, termed sympathetic long-term facilitation. Our understanding of sympathetic long-term facilitation following hypoxia in humans is based on multiunit muscle sympathetic nerve activity and does not fully characterize the underlying baroreflex control of sympathetic neuronal subpopulations or their discharge/recruitment strategies. We show that sympathetic long-term facilitation is mediated by baroreflex resetting of sympathetic action potential clusters to higher arterial pressure operating points, a reduction in the percentage of action potentials firing asynchronously, and a shift toward larger amplitude action potential activity. The results advance our fundamental understanding of how the sympathetic nervous system mediates sympathetic long-term facilitation following exposure to acute isocapnic hypoxia in humans."
