TI  - Action potential amplitude and baroreflex resetting of action potential clusters 
      mediate hypoxia-induced sympathetic long-term facilitation.
LID - 10.1113/JP282933 [doi]
AB  - Baroreflex resetting permits sympathetic long-term facilitation (sLTF) following 
      hypoxia; however, baroreflex control of action potential (AP) clusters and AP 
      recruitment patterns facilitating sLTF is unknown. We hypothesized that 
      baroreflex resetting of arterial pressure operating points (OPs) of AP clusters 
      and recruitment of large-amplitude APs would mediate sLTF following hypoxia. 
      Eight men (age: 24 (3) years; body mass index: 24 (3) kg/m(2) ) underwent 20 min 
      isocapnic hypoxia ( PETO2 : 47 (2) mmHg) and 30 min recovery. Multi-unit 
      microneurography (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA) and a continuous 
      wavelet transform with matched mother wavelet was used to detect sympathetic APs 
      during baseline, hypoxia, early (first 5 min), and late recovery (last 5 min). AP 
      amplitude (normalized to largest baseline AP amplitude), percentage APs occurring 
      outside a MSNA burst (percentage asynchronous APs), and proportion of APs firing 
      in small (1-3), medium (4-6) and large (7-10) normalized cluster sizes was 
      calculated. Normalized clusters were used to assess baroreflex OPs and 
      sensitivity. Hypoxia increased total MSNA activity, which remained elevated 
      during recovery (P < 0.0001). Baroreflex OPs were shifted rightward for all 
      clusters in recovery, with no effect on slope. Compared to baseline, AP amplitude 
      was elevated by 3 (2)% and 4 (2)% while asynchronous APs were reduced by 9 (5)% 
      and 7 (6)% in early and late recovery, respectively. In early recovery, the 
      proportion of APs firing in large clusters was increased compared to baseline. 
      Hypoxia-induced sLTF is mediated by baroreflex resetting of AP clusters to higher 
      OPs, reduced asynchronous AP firing, and increased contribution from 
      large-amplitude APs. KEY POINTS: Acute isocapnic hypoxia resets the arterial 
      baroreflex and permits long-lasting sympathoexcitation, termed sympathetic 
      long-term facilitation. Our understanding of sympathetic long-term facilitation 
      following hypoxia in humans is based on multiunit muscle sympathetic nerve 
      activity and does not fully characterize the underlying baroreflex control of 
      sympathetic neuronal subpopulations or their discharge/recruitment strategies. We 
      show that sympathetic long-term facilitation is mediated by baroreflex resetting 
      of sympathetic action potential clusters to higher arterial pressure operating 
      points, a reduction in the percentage of action potentials firing asynchronously, 
      and a shift toward larger amplitude action potential activity. The results 
      advance our fundamental understanding of how the sympathetic nervous system 
      mediates sympathetic long-term facilitation following exposure to acute isocapnic 
      hypoxia in humans.
