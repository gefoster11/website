AB  - Doherty, Connor J., Jou-Chung Chang, Benjamin P. Thompson, Erik R. Swenson, Glen 
      E. Foster, and Paolo B. Dominelli. The impact of acetazolamide and methazolamide 
      on exercise performance in normoxia and hypoxia. High Alt Med Biol. 24:7-18, 
      2023.-Carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors are commonly prescribed for acute 
      mountain sickness (AMS). In this review, we sought to examine how two CA 
      inhibitors, acetazolamide (AZ) and methazolamide (MZ), affect exercise 
      performance in normoxia and hypoxia. First, we briefly describe the role of CA 
      inhibition in facilitating the increase in ventilation and arterial oxygenation 
      in preventing and treating AMS. Next, we detail how AZ affects exercise 
      performance in normoxia and hypoxia and this is followed by a discussion on MZ. 
      We emphasize that the overarching focus of the review is how the two drugs 
      potentially affect exercise performance, rather than their ability to 
      prevent/treat AMS per se, their interrelationship will be discussed. Overall, we 
      suggest that AZ hinders exercise performance in normoxia, but may be beneficial 
      in hypoxia. Based upon head-to-head studies of AZ and MZ in humans on 
      diaphragmatic and locomotor strength in normoxia, MZ may be a better CA inhibitor 
      when exercise performance is crucial at high altitude.
