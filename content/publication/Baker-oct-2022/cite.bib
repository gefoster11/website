AB  - Cerebral hypoxia is a serious consequence of several cardiorespiratory illnesses. 
      Measuring the retinal microvasculature at high altitude provides a surrogate for 
      cerebral microvasculature, offering potential insight into cerebral hypoxia in 
      critical illness. In addition, although sex-specific differences in 
      cardiovascular diseases are strongly supported, few have focused on differences 
      in ocular blood flow. We evaluated the retinal microvasculature in males (n = 11) 
      and females (n = 7) using functional optical coherence tomography at baseline 
      (1,130 m) (day 0), following rapid ascent (day 2), and prolonged exposure (day 9) 
      to high altitude (3,800 m). Retinal vascular perfusion density (rVPD; an index of 
      total blood supply), retinal thickness (RT; reflecting vascular and neural tissue 
      volume), and arterial blood were acquired. As a group, rVPD increased on day 2 
      versus day 0 (P < 0.001) and was inversely related to [Formula: see text] 
      (R(2) = 0.45; P = 0.006). By day 9, rVPD recovered to baseline but was 
      significantly lower in males than in females (P = 0.007). RT was not different on 
      day 2 versus day 0 (P > 0.99) but was reduced by day 9 relative to day 0 and day 
      2 (P < 0.001). RT changes relative to day 0 were inversely related to changes in 
      [Formula: see text] on day 2 (R(2) = 0.6; P = 0.001) and day 9 (R(2) = 0.4; P = 
      0.02). RT did not differ between sexes. These data suggest differential time 
      course and regulation of the retina during rapid ascent and prolonged exposure to 
      high altitude and are the first to demonstrate sex-specific differences in rVPD 
      at high altitude. The ability to assess intact microvasculature contiguous with 
      the brain has widespread research and clinical applications.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      Measuring the retinal microvasculature at high altitude provides a surrogate for 
      cerebral microvasculature, offering potential insight into consequence of 
      cerebral hypoxia in critical illness. This study demonstrates dynamic regulation 
      of the retina during rapid ascent and prolonged exposure to high altitude and is 
      the first to demonstrate sex-specific differences in retinal microvasculature at 
      high altitude. The ability to dynamically assess intact microvasculature 
      contiguous with the brain has widespread research and clinical applications.
