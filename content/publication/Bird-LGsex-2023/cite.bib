AB  - Rationale: Central sleep apnea (CSA) is pervasive during sleep at high altitude, 
      disproportionately impacting men and associated with increased peripheral 
      chemosensitivity. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether biological sex affects 
      loop gain (LGn) and CSA severity during sleep over 9-10 days of acclimatization 
      to 3,800 m. We hypothesized that CSA severity would worsen with acclimatization 
      in men but not in women because of greater increases in LGn in men. Methods: 
      Sleep studies were collected from 20 (12 male) healthy participants at low 
      altitude (1,130 m, baseline) and after ascent to (nights 2/3, acute) and 
      residence at high altitude (nights 9/10, prolonged). CSA severity was quantified 
      as the respiratory event index (REI) as a surrogate of the apnea-hypopnea index. 
      LGn, a measure of ventilatory control instability, was quantified using a 
      ventilatory control model fit to nasal flow. Linear mixed models evaluated 
      effects of time at altitude and sex on respiratory event index and LGn. Data are 
      presented as contrast means with 95% confidence intervals. Results: REI was 
      comparable between men and women at acute altitude (4.1 [-9.3, 17.5] events/h; 
      P = 0.54) but significantly greater in men at prolonged altitude (23.7 [10.3, 
      37.1] events/h; P = 0.0008). Men had greater LGn than did women for acute (0.08 
      [0.001, 0.15]; P = 0.047) and prolonged (0.17 [0.10, 0.25]; P < 0.0001) altitude. 
      The change in REI per change in LGn was significantly greater in men than in 
      women (107 ± 46 events/h/LGn; P = 0.02). Conclusions: The LGn response to high 
      altitude differed between sexes and contributed to worsening of CSA over time in 
      men but not in women. This sex difference in acclimatization appears to protect 
      females from high altitude-related CSA. These data provide fundamental 
      sex-specific physiological insight into high-altitude acclimatization in healthy 
      individuals and may help to inform sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing 
      pathogenesis in patients with cardiorespiratory disease.
