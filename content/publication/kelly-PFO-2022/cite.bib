AB  - OBJECTIVES: During apnea diving, a patent foramen ovale may function as a 
      pressure relief valve under conditions of high pulmonary pressure, preserving 
      left-ventricular output. Patent foramen ovale prevalence in apneic divers has not 
      been previously reported. We aimed to determine the prevalence of patent foramen 
      ovale in apneic divers compared to non-divers. DESIGN: Cross sectional. METHODS: 
      Apnea divers were recruited from a training camp in Cavtat, Croatia and the 
      diving community of Split, Croatia. Controls were recruited from the population 
      of Split, Croatia and Eugene, Oregon, USA. Participants were instrumented with an 
      intravenous catheter and underwent patent foramen ovale screening utilizing 
      transthoracic saline contrast echocardiography. Appearance of microbubbles in the 
      left heart within 3 cardiac cycles indicated the presence of patent foramen 
      ovale. Lung function was measured with spirometry. Comparison of patent foramen 
      ovale prevalence was conducted using chi-square analysis, p < .05. RESULTS: Apnea 
      divers had a significantly higher prevalence of patent foramen ovale (19 of 36, 
      53%) compared to controls (9 of 36, 25%) (X(2) (1, N = 72) = 5.844, p = .0156). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Why patent foramen ovale prevalence is greater in apnea divers 
      remains unknown, though hyperbaria during an apnea dive results in a 
      translocation of blood volume centrally with a concomitant reduction in lung 
      volume and alveolar hypoxia during ascent results in hypoxic pulmonary 
      vasoconstriction. These conditions increase pulmonary arterial pressure, 
      increasing right-atrial pressure allowing for right-to-left blood flow through a 
      patent foramen ovale which may be beneficial for preserving cardiac output and 
      reducing capillary hydrostatic forces.
