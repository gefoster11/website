TI  - The effects of acute normobaric hypoxia on vestibular-evoked balance responses in 
      humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxia influences standing balance and vestibular function. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose here was to investigate the effect of hypoxia on the 
      vestibular control of balance. METHODS: Twenty participants (10 males; 10 
      females) were tested over two days (normobaric hypoxia and normoxia). 
      Participants stood on a force plate (head rotated leftward) and experienced 
      random, continuous electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) during trials of eyes 
      open (EO) and closed (EC) at baseline (BL), after 5 (H1), 30 (H2) and 55-min (H3) 
      of hypoxia, and 10-min into normoxic recovery (NR). Vestibular-evoked balance 
      responses were quantified using cumulant density, coherence, and gain functions 
      between EVS and anteroposterior forces. RESULTS: Oxyhemoglobin saturation, 
      end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide decreased for H1-3 compared to BL; however, 
      end-tidal carbon dioxide remained reduced at NR with EC (p≤0.003). EVS-AP force 
      peak-to-peak amplitude was lower at H3 and NR than at BL (p≤0.01). At multiple 
      frequencies, EVS-AP force coherence and gain estimates were lower at H3 and NR 
      than BL for females; however, this was only observed for coherence for males. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, vestibular-evoked balance responses are blunted following 
      normobaric hypoxia >30 min, which persists into NR and may contribute to the 
      reported increases in postural sway.
