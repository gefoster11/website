TI  - The coronary vascular response to the metaboreflex at low-altitude and during 
      acute and prolonged high-altitude in males.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00018.2022 [doi]
AB  - Myocardial oxygen delivery is primarily regulated through changes in vascular 
      tone to match increased metabolic demands. In males, activation of the muscle 
      metaboreflex during acute isocapnic hypoxia results in a paradoxical coronary 
      vasoconstriction. Whether coronary blood velocity is reduced by metaboreflex 
      activation following travel and/or adaptation to high-altitude is unknown. This 
      study determined if the response of the coronary vasculature to muscle 
      metaboreflex activation at low-altitude differs from acute (1/2 days) and 
      prolonged (8/9 days) high-altitude. Healthy males (n=16) were recruited and 
      performed isometric handgrip exercise (30 % max) followed by post-exercise 
      circulatory occlusion (PECO) to isolate the muscle metaboreflex at low-altitude 
      and following acute and prolonged high-altitude (3,800 m). Mean left anterior 
      descending coronary artery blood velocity (LADv(mean), transthoracic Doppler 
      echocardiography), heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), ventilation, and 
      respired gases were assessed during baseline and PECO at all time-points. 
      Coronary vascular conductance index (CVC(i)) was calculated as LAD(Vmean)/MAP. 
      The change in LADv(mean) (acute altitude: -1.7 ± 3.9 cm/s, low-altitude: 2.6 ± 
      3.4 cm/s, P = 0.01) and CVC(i) (acute altitude: -0.05 ± 0.04 cm/s/mmHg, 
      low-altitude: -0.01 ± 0.03 cm/s/mmHg, P = 0.005) induced by PECO differed 
      significantly between acute high-altitude and low-altitude. The change in 
      LAD(Vmean) and CVC(i) induced by PECO following prolonged high-altitude was not 
      different from low-altitude. Our results suggest that coronary vasoconstriction 
      with metaboreflex activation in males is greatest following acute ascent to 
      high-altitude and restored to low-altitude levels following 8-9 days of 
      acclimatization.
