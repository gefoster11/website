TI  - Acute hypoxia elicits lasting reductions in the sympathetic action potential 
      transduction of arterial blood pressure in males.
LID - 10.1113/JP283979 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Acute isocapnic hypoxia elicits lasting sympathoexcitation that does 
      not correspond to parallel changes in vascular tone, suggesting blunted 
      sympathetic transduction. Signal-averaging techniques track the magnitude and 
      temporal cardiovascular responses following integrated muscle sympathetic nerve 
      activity (MSNA) burst and nonburst cardiac cycles; however, this does not fully 
      characterize the effects of sympathetic action potential (AP) activity on blood 
      pressure control. We show that hypoxia blunts the sympathetic transduction of 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) following synchronous APs that form integrated MSNA 
      bursts and that sympathetic transduction of MAP remains attenuated into early 
      recovery. At rest, asynchronous APs attenuate the reduction in MAP compared to 
      cardiac cycles following no AP activity, thus asynchronous sympathetic APs appear 
      to contribute to the neural regulation of blood pressure. The results advance our 
      understanding of sympathetic transduction of arterial pressure during and 
      following exposure to acute isocapnic hypoxia in humans. ABSTRACT: Post-hypoxia 
      sympathoexcitation does not elicit corresponding changes in vascular tone, 
      suggesting diminished sympathetic signalling. Blunted sympathetic transduction 
      following acute hypoxia, however, has not been confirmed and the effects of 
      hypoxia on the sympathetic transduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a 
      function of action potential (AP) activity is unknown. We hypothesized that MAP 
      changes would be blunted during acute hypoxia but restored in recovery and 
      asynchronous APs would elicit smaller MAP changes compared to synchronous APs. 
      Seven healthy males (age: 24 (3) yrs; BMI: 25 (3) kg/m(2) ) underwent 20-min 
      isocapnic hypoxia (P(ET) O(2) : 47 (2) mmHg) and 30-min recovery. Multi-unit 
      microneurography (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA) and continuous wavelet 
      transform with matched mother wavelet was used to detect sympathetic APs during 
      baseline, hypoxia, early (first 7-min), and late recovery (last 7-min). AP groups 
      were classified as synchronous APs, asynchronous APs (occurring outside a MSNA 
      burst), and no AP activity. Sympathetic transduction of MAP was quantified using 
      signal-averaging, with ΔMAP tracked following AP group cardiac cycles. Following 
      synchronous APs, ΔMAP was reduced in hypoxia (+1.8 (0.9) mmHg) and early recovery 
      (+1.5 (0.7) mmHg) compared to baseline (+3.1 (2.2) mmHg). AP group-by-condition 
      interactions show that at rest asynchronous APs attenuate MAP reductions compared 
      to no AP activity (-0.4 (1.1) vs. -2.2 (1.2) mmHg, respectively), with no 
      difference between AP groups in hypoxia, early, or late recovery. Sympathetic 
      transduction of MAP is blunted in hypoxia and early recovery. At rest, 
      asynchronous sympathetic APs contributes to neural regulation of MAP by 
      attenuating nadir pressure responses. Abstract figure legend Seven healthy men 
      underwent 20-min isocapnic hypoxia and 30-min recovery. The study tested the 
      hypotheses that hypoxia would blunt the sympathetic transduction of mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP) following synchronous AP activity and that asynchronous APs would 
      elicit smaller ΔMAP compared to synchronous APs. All sympathetic APs were 
      detected and extracted from the filtered MSNA neurogram using a continuous 
      wavelet transform with matched mother wavelet. AP groups were classified as 
      synchronous (with MSNA burst), asynchronous (outside MSNA burst), and no AP 
      activity. An effect of condition showed that following synchronous APs, ΔMAP was 
      reduced in hypoxia and early recovery compared to baseline. AP group-by-condition 
      interactions revealed that asynchronous APs attenuate MAP reductions compared to 
      no AP activity under resting conditions. Our findings demonstrate that 
      sympathetic transduction of MAP is blunted in hypoxia and remains diminished into 
      early recovery. At rest, asynchronous AP activity contributes to MAP regulation 
      by attenuating pressure reductions. This article is protected by copyright. All
