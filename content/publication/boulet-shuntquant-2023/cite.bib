AB  - Transthoracic saline contrast echocardiography is commonly used to assess 
      intrathoracic shunt flow in vivo. Though the technique has many advantages (safe, 
      simple, repeatable), the measurement technique lacks specificity, and the 
      contrast agent has limited stability. This study sought to determine if the 
      indicator dilution modeling technique could be applied to ultrasound contrast 
      data to quantify shunt fraction and to determine if buoyant force has a 
      significant effect on microbubble pathway determination at a "vascular" 
      bifurcation. A model of the pulmonary circuit was perfused with blood at three 
      distinct flow rates (low, medium and high) over shunt fractions ranging from 
      ∼2-10 %. The buoyancy effect on contrast was quantified using a simplified in 
      vitro model of a vascular bifurcation that had an upper and lower outflow tract 
      where saline contrast formed from carbon monoxide (CO) gas passed through the 
      bifurcation, was collected and quantified. The indicator dilution model was found 
      to have a mean bias of - 3.2 % for the low flow stage, - 2.6 % for the medium 
      flow stage and - 1.4 % for the high flow stage compared to volumetric 
      measurements, suggesting agreement increases with increasing flow rate. 
      Investigations of the buoyant effects revealed that at lower flow rates, contrast 
      bubbles that encounter a bifurcation will favor the upper outflow tract over the 
      lower. However, this effect is reduced by increasing the flow rate two-fold. 
      These data identify that application of indicator dilution theory to contrast 
      ultrasound data and the pathway ultrasound contrast travels in a network of 
      tubules is flow dependent.
