abstract: "The cerebrovasculature responds to blood gas challenges. Regional differences (anterior vs. posterior) in cerebrovascular responses to increases in CO2 have been extensively studied. However, regional cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) responses to low O2 (hypoxia) are equivocal, likely due to differences in analysis. We assessed the effects of acute isocapnic hypoxia on regional CVR comparing absolute and relative (%-change) responses in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). We instrumented 14 healthy participants with a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood velocity), finometer (beat-by-beat blood pressure), dual gas analyzer (end-tidal CO2 and O2), and utilized a dynamic end-tidal forcing system to elicit a single 5-min bout of isocapnic hypoxia (∼45 Torr PETO2, ∼80 % SpO2). During exposure to acute hypoxia, absolute responses were larger in the anterior compared to posterior cerebral circulation (P < 0.001), but were not different when comparing relative responses (P = 0.45). Consistent reporting of CVR to hypoxia will aid understanding normative responses, particularly in assessing populations with impaired cerebrovascular function."
