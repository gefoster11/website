AB  - The cerebrovasculature responds to blood gas challenges. Regional differences 
      (anterior vs. posterior) in cerebrovascular responses to increases in CO(2) have 
      been extensively studied. However, regional cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) 
      responses to low O(2) (hypoxia) are equivocal, likely due to differences in 
      analysis. We assessed the effects of acute isocapnic hypoxia on regional CVR 
      comparing absolute and relative (%-change) responses in the middle cerebral artery 
      (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). We instrumented 14 healthy participants 
      with a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood velocity), finometer 
      (beat-by-beat blood pressure), dual gas analyzer (end-tidal CO(2) and O(2)), and 
      utilized a dynamic end-tidal forcing system to elicit a single 5-min bout of 
      isocapnic hypoxia (∼45 Torr P(ET)O(2), ∼80 % SpO(2)). During exposure to acute 
      hypoxia, absolute responses were larger in the anterior compared to posterior 
      cerebral circulation (P < 0.001), but were not different when comparing relative 
      responses (P = 0.45). Consistent reporting of CVR to hypoxia will aid understanding 
      normative responses, particularly in assessing populations with impaired 
      cerebrovascular function.
