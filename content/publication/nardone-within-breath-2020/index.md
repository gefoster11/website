abstract: "Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) exhibits well-described within-breath respiratory modulation, but the interactive contributions of the arterial baroreflex remain unclear. The present study assessed 1) within-breath modulation of sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and 2) the effect of acute intermittent hypercapnic hypoxia (IHH) on within-breath sympathetic BRS and respiratory-sympathetic entrainment. Seventeen men (24 ± 4 yr) underwent an 8- to 10-min spontaneously breathing baseline while continuous measures of blood pressure (BP), heart rate, MSNA, ventilation, and end-tidal gases were collected. A subset of 12 participants subsequently underwent a 40-min IHH exposure composed of 40 consecutive 1-min breathing cycles: 40 s of hypercapnic hypoxia and 20 s of normoxia. Data were compared between inspiration and expiration and low and high lung volume (calculated from the integral of spirometry-derived flow). Sympathetic BRS was determined by the slope of the weighted linear regression between diastolic BP and MSNA burst incidence. Respiratory-sympathetic entrainment was quantified as percentage of MSNA bursts during each respiratory epoch relative to the total burst count. Sympathetic BRS was similar between inspiration and expiration (−3.9 ± 2.0 vs. −3.6 ± 1.8 bursts·100 heartbeats−1·mmHg−1; P = 0.61) but greater during low versus high lung volumes (−4.6 ± 2.3 vs. −2.1 ± 1.6 bursts·100 heartbeats−1·mmHg−1; P textless 0.01). High (r = −0.64; P textless 0.01)- but not low (r = −0.24; P = 0.35)-lung volume sympathetic BRS was associated with resting MSNA. IHH increased resting MSNA burst frequency (15 ± 7 vs. 20 ± 7 bursts/min; P textless 0.01) and diastolic BP (68 ± 5 vs. 77 ± 9 mmHg; P = 0.02), without altering resting or within-breath sympathetic BRS or respiratory-sympathetic entrainment (all P textgreater 0.05). These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms controlling within-breath modulation of sympathetic outflow in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In resting spontaneously breathing men, the present study observed that sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was higher during low versus high lung volumes but not different between inspiration and expiration. High- but not low-lung volume BRS was negatively associated with resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Acute intermittent hypercapnic hypoxia increased resting MSNA and diastolic blood pressure, without altering within-breath BRS. These findings provide novel insight into mechanisms controlling within-breath modulation of MSNA in humans."
