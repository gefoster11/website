TI  - Effects of sex and ageing on the human respiratory muscle metaboreflex.
LID - 10.1113/JP283838 [doi]
AB  - Intense inspiratory muscle work evokes a sympathetically mediated pressor reflex, 
      termed the respiratory muscle metaboreflex, in which young females demonstrate an 
      attenuated response relative to males. However, the effects of ageing and female 
      sex hormones on the respiratory muscle metaboreflex are unclear. We tested the 
      hypothesis that the pressor response to inspiratory work would be similar between 
      older males and females, and higher relative to their younger counterparts. 
      Healthy, normotensive young (26 ± 3 years) males (YM; n = 10) and females (YF; 
      n = 10), as well as older (64 ± 5 years) males (OM; n = 10) and females (OF; 
      n = 10), performed inspiratory pressure threshold loading (PTL) to task failure. 
      Older adults had a greater mean arterial pressure (MAP) response to PTL than 
      young (P < 0.001). YF had a lower MAP compared to YM (+10 ± 6 vs. +19 ± 15 mmHg, 
      P = 0.026); however, there was no difference observed between OF and OM (+26 ± 11 
      vs. +27 ± 11 mmHg, P = 0.162). Older adults had a lower heart rate response to 
      PTL than young (P = 0.002). There was no effect of sex between young females and 
      males (+19 ± 9 and +27 ± 11 bpm, P = 0.186) or older females and males (+17 ± 7 
      and +20 ± 7 bpm, P = 0.753). We conclude the respiratory muscle metaboreflex 
      response is heightened in older adults, and the sex effect between older males 
      and post-menopause females is absent, suggesting an effect of circulating sex 
      hormones. KEY POINTS: The arterial blood pressure response to the respiratory 
      muscle metaboreflex is greater in older males and females. Compared to 
      sex-matched young individuals, there is no sex differences in the blood pressure 
      response between older males and post-menopause females. Our results suggest the 
      differences between males and females in the cardiovascular response to high 
      levels of inspiratory muscle work is abolished with reduced circulating female 
      sex hormones.
