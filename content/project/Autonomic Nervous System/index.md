title: Autonomic Nervous System
summary: Sympathetic overactivity is a hallmark of many chronic diseases including sleep apnea and heart failure.  Our studies of simulated sleep apnea determine the influence of intermittent hypoxia on sympathetic overactivity. The effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on sympathetic recruitment and the transduction of a sympathetic signal into a cardiovascular response is an area we are currently focused on.
