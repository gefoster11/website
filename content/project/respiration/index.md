title: Respiration
summary: The sensitivity of the respiratory control system can dictate human success in the high altitude environment and can contribute to disease. Our research focuses on how respiratory chemoreception impacts breathing stability at altitude and how simulated sleep apnea influences respiratory control. We are currently developing a novel approach to better understand the redistribution of blood flow to the muscles of respiration during increases in respiratory work.
