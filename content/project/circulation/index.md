title: Circulation
summary: The cardiovascular system is highly responsive to respiratory and autonomic nervous system reflexes. Our research focuses on regulatory mechanisms including pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia. Recent work addresses how the coronary circulation responds to a combination of chemoreflex and metaboreflex activation. Additionally, our studies of simulated sleep apnea determine the influence of intermittent hypoxia on cardiovascular control.
