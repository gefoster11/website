date: 2021-07-16T02:05:06.249Z
summary: The cardiovascular system is highly responsive to respiratory and
  autonomic nervous system reflexes. Our research focuses on regulatory
  mechanisms including pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia. Recent work
  addresses how the coronary circulation responds to a combination of
  chemoreflex and metaboreflex activation. Additionally, our studies of
  simulated sleep apnea determine the influence of intermittent hypoxia on
  cardiovascular control.
